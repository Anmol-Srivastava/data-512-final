# Tracking the Prison-Industrial Complex

This repository hosts my final project for DATA 512 (Human-Centered Data Science), which is intended to be a reproducible, useful, and user-friendly body of research and analysis. My proposed project is the use of US Census Data and US Bureau of Justice statistics to investigate the explosion of the prison-industrial complex (PIC). The PIC broadly refers to the governmental and corporate involvement in prison development and use; in my project, I will track the geographical and time-wise "ground zero" or "points of origin" for the vast expansion thereof. I will use prison population data and operational information to track the growth in American prison populations and "industries", across time.
